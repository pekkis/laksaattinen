[Guitar intro]

[Verse 1]
In the dawn of the web, a battle began,
Netscape Navigator, the first in the land.
Microsoft entered with Internet Explorer,
Two giants clashing, the stakes growing higher.

[Verse 2]
Lines of code, relentless fight,
Browsers competing day and night.
For dominance on the internet stage,
A war of features, speed, and rage.

[Power Metal Chant, Gang Vocals]
[Chorus]
Code and conquest, wars of the web,
Battles fought in lines unread.
Browsers clash, and frameworks rise,
In the digital world, where glory lies.
From the first byte to the final call,
Heroes of tech, we honor them all.

[Bridge]
The battle raged, the victors stood tall,
Yet whispers of change echoed the hall.
New challengers rose, with fire in their eyes,
The stage was set, for the next grand prize.
Old foes regrouped, new strategies planned,
As the web expanded, across every land.

[Verse 3]
The first war ended, but peace was short,
Firefox emerged, a new report.
Chrome by Google, swift and light,
Another battle, another fight.

[Guitar solo, long, with symphony orchestra]

[Verse 4]
Innovations, speed, and security,
Browsers racing for supremacy.
Extensions, tabs, and privacy,
Each seeking the user's loyalty.

[Chorus]
Code and conquest, wars of the web,
Battles fought in lines unread.
Browsers clash, and frameworks rise,
In the digital world, where glory lies.
From the first byte to the final call,
Heroes of tech, we honor them all.
