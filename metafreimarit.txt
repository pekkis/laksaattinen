[Verse]
In the world of code, there's a tale to be told,  
Angular’s old, getting lukewarm and cold,  
“Too complex,” they say, “dependency hell,”  
But once it ruled, oh well, oh well.

[Chorus]
React’s the star, shining bright in the night,  
“Virtual DOM, hooks, it’s all so right,”  
Developers sing its praises so high,  
With React, the limit’s the sky.

[Verse]
Solid’s sleek, with performance so fine,  
Reactive core, it’s ahead of its time,  
Astro’s new, with islands of code,  
Mixing static and dynamic, it’s breaking the mold.

[Bridge]
Remix comes along, with routes to define,  
Flexible, fast, it’s truly divine,  
Qwik’s the name, lightning’s its game,  
Resuming state, putting others to shame.

[Chorus]
React’s the star, shining bright in the night,  
“Virtual DOM, hooks, it’s all so right,”  
Developers sing its praises so high,  
With React, the limit’s the sky.

[Outro]
Framework wars in the digital age,  
Innovation on every page,  
Choose your tools, build your dreams,  
In the world of code, nothing’s as it seems.
